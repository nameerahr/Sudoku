# Sudoku

This is a Sudoku game created using Python. A GUI for the game was created using PyGame to display an interactable board for players. Players must start 
by selecting their pen type, pencil or marker. Entries entered using pencil are temporary and can be deleted. Entries entered using marker are final 
and cannot be deleted. If a mistake is made while entering final values, the board can be reset to try again. Players are able to switch between pen types
at any time.
